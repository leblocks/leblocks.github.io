## About me
I'm a backend developer with a strong focus on open-source tools. I mostly work from the terminal, utilizing its tools for about 90% of my tasks.
I'm dedicated to keeping code bases clean and consistent, following the belief that the best code is often the code that's been wisely deleted.
